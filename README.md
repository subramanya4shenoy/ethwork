# Ethwork
Project to build a system with  ethereum block chain. Building a supply chain project (from the tutorials)
decentralized Application to create your own token(crypto currency) and allow only the specific participants to do the purchase. And use the same token to be used in the supply chain.

Allowing only few participants because each time any read write operation happens in the block chain we need to pay a agasprice and that we dont want and this is just a first dApp i created for testing on Ethereum network.

Creating a token based on commonly used ERC20 token.
