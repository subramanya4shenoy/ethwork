# Ethwork
Project to build a system with  ethereum block chain. Building a supply chain project (from the tutorials)
decentralized Application to create your own token(crypto currency) and allow only the specific participants to do the purchase. And use the same token to be used in the supply chain.

Allowing only few participants because each time any read write operation happens in the block chain we need to pay a agasprice and that we dont want and this is just a first dApp created for testing on Ethereum network.

Creating a token based on commonly used ERC20 token. 

# Knowledge and Tool set Requiered
ðŸ¥· Truffle suite : To run the whole projects. takes care of boilerplate and environments.
ðŸ¥· Ganache: Provides the test ether network with dummy 100eth (10 accounts) to test the smart contracts
ðŸ¥· Solidity: Programing language to write the smart contract for block chain.


# Additional Knowledge & tools: 
ðŸ¥· MetaMask : which is like a wallet, this holds your private key.

Boiler plate can be easily generated via Truffle. once done change the config to set the network port to point to test.
Test is nothing but Ganache, so keep the ganache up and running. and also update the port number in the boiler plate (default :7545).
Write your smart contracts and run it in ganache. 

# Conclution:
Not persuing on this project. It looked this might require few more years for the technology to catch up and make things easier to integrate. 

Solidy is still in version 0.8.x . 

All the code looks like Boiler plates and templates. 

Once deployed in main net there is a gas price (real money ~ Ether ~ crypto), which gets deducted for each transaction. 
Even though the fee is less it doesnt makes any sense to use deploy a test project in main net. 

Currently, we use block chain to a chained systems, which has a suply chain from producer to consumer. Or a system which requires 100% autonoums. 
Example is currencies. currencies are mined automatically and circulated and all the flow and transactions are kept in the network. each currency is nothing but a hash `string`. but this string is uniq and cannot be recreated (decoded). So, every entity say, currency or NFT is nothing but a hash string. The value of this increase/ decreases via trading. as many hash strings (or many coins) get mined it will be very difficult to mine more coins (or the hash string) so there is a fee which goes towards mining (it will go to a miner who finds the hash). Also, once found this perticular hash will be updated throughout the network and even then a small fee is payed. Both of these fee included is called as gas fee. This gas fee can be charged to the owner who requests for the new key.  

Based on the top points the industry these features are required is Banking transactions and currency related. So there are handfull of companies/projects which flaunt about using block chains for this. Those are called as deFi = decentralized Finance.

Just like deFi, we do see lot of other projects to like deSo = decentralized Social etc.. But i do not see any actual use of block chains in them. they are probably using token system (deFI) inside their projects and the front cover is told to be just Social networking sites.

Currently, as of now I donot see any practicle use of block chains in our regular projects or activities. 
I might be wrong (I hope). If you know anywhere this is used differently or some of the project if you can suggest me It will help me to change my perspective.
